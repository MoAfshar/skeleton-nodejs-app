## Create Your Own Fork

Fork this project to create a repo under your own GitHub account, so that you can commit and push to it.
Then clone the code from your fork onto your machine.


## Install Dependencies

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed.


## Running Locally

```sh
$ cd skeleton-node-js-app
$ npm install

```

Now try the following request in your browser: [http://localhost:5000/api?q=Who wrote Romeo and Juliet?]
This should call the code in `queryProcessor.js`.

## Run the unit tests

The skeleton app comes with a small set of unit tests (see the file `test.js`), which you can add to as you add functionality. Run the tests like this:

```sh
$ cd skeleton-node-js-app
$ npm test
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).
